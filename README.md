self-introduction about myself.

I am ShinyAkira,
a caustic and whimsical observer and discussant.
I am fascinated with design, anime, tech and rail and recently engaged in relevant research. I live here nowadays, and I learned how to behave there in a very young age. Apart from here, I deepen my insights in a place called society.
When you have spare time, you can find me there.
And I babble here some of the times.
